   cd trading
   ```

2. **Copy environment configuration**

   ```bash
   cp env.local .env
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**

   Edit `.env` with your credentials:

   ```bash
   # AWS Configuration (for Claude AI via Bedrock)
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_key
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret
   AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1

   # Langfuse (AI Observability)
   LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY=your_langfuse_public_key
   LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=your_langfuse_secret_key
   LANGFUSE_HOST=https://us.cloud.langfuse.com

   # Binance Trading Configuration
   BINANCE_API_KEY=your_binance_api_key
   BINANCE_API_SECRET=your_binance_api_secret

   # Database
   POSTGRES_USER=postgres_user
   POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres_password
   POSTGRES_DB=app_db
   ```

4. **Start with Docker Compose** (Recommended)

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   The API will be available at `http://localhost:8099`

5. **Or run locally**

   ```bash
   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements/base.txt

   # Run migrations
   python manage.py migrate

   # Create superuser for admin access
   python manage.py createsuperuser

   # Start the server
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

### TrendRadar Integration (News Aggregation)

SharkBot integrates with [TrendRadar](https://github.com/sansan0/TrendRadar), a news aggregation tool that monitors 35+ platforms for crypto and trading-related news.

**What it provides:**
- Real-time news aggregation from Chinese platforms (Weibo, Douyin, Baidu, etc.)
- Keyword filtering for crypto/trading topics (BTC, ETH, SOL, etc.)
- SQLite database storage for news data
- Web interface at `http://localhost:8080`
- Optional AI analysis via MCP server

**Included Services:**
- `trend-radar`: Main news crawler service
- `trend-radar-mcp`: AI analysis service (optional)

**Configuration:**
- Keywords: Edit `trendradar/config/frequency_words.txt`
- Settings: Edit `trendradar/config/config.yaml`
- Data storage: `trendradar/output/` (SQLite, TXT, HTML)

**Accessing News Data:**

From your Python code, you can read the SQLite database:

```python
import sqlite3
from pathlib import Path

# Find the latest database file
output_dir = Path("trendradar/output")
db_files = list(output_dir.glob("**/*.db"))
latest_db = max(db_files, key=lambda p: p.stat().st_mtime)

# Connect and query
conn = sqlite3.connect(latest_db)
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM news WHERE created_at > datetime('now', '-1 hour')")
recent_news = cursor.fetchall()


## 📖 Usage

### Starting the Trading Bot

The bot can be run in two ways:

#### 1. Manual Execution (for testing)

```bash
python main.py
```

This will run a single trading cycle and exit.

#### 2. Automated Scheduling (for production)

The bot includes an APScheduler that runs the trading workflow at configured intervals:

```python
# In your Django app startup (apps/tradings/apps.py)
from apps.tradings.scheduler import start_scheduler

start_scheduler()
```

The scheduler is automatically started when Django loads the `tradings` app.

### Accessing the Admin Dashboard

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:8099/admin`
2. Log in with your superuser credentials
3. You can view:
   - **Trading Workflow Executions**: Full history of all bot runs
   - **Trading Operations**: Individual trade records (open/close positions)
   - **Market data and analysis**: Agent reasoning and decisions

### Viewing the Dashboard

Access the HTML dashboard at `http://localhost:8099/` (or view `index.html`) to see:

- Real-time balance and PnL
- Win rate and trade statistics
- Market data with technical indicators
- Open positions
- AI agent analysis and reasoning

### Customizing the AI Prompt

The trading strategy is defined in `apps/genflows/prompts/trading_futures/trad.txt`. You can customize:

- Risk parameters
- Technical indicators
- Trading rules
- Decision-making framework

The system prompt is rendered from templates in `apps/genflows/prompts/`.

## 📊 Monitoring & Observability

### Langfuse Integration

All AI workflow executions are traced in Langfuse, providing:

- Complete conversation history
- Token usage and costs
- Agent reasoning chains
- Tool usage tracking
- Performance metrics

Access your Langfuse dashboard to monitor AI performance.

### Django Admin

The admin interface provides:

- Execution history with full market data snapshots
- Trade logs with entry/exit prices and PnL
- Agent responses and strategies
- Error logs and debugging information

### Risk Warnings

- Cryptocurrency trading carries substantial risk
- Past performance does not guarantee future results
- Use at your own risk - this is experimental software
- Never trade with money you can't afford to lose
- The bot can make mistakes - always monitor it
